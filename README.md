"Technical analysis may appear complicated on the surface, but it boils down to an analysis of supply and demand in the market to determine 
where the price trend is headed. In other words, technical analysis attempts to understand the market sentiment behind price trends rather 
than analyzing a securityâ€™s fundamental attributes."
